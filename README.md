# Reinforcement Learning & Decision Making (2024/2025)
This is a repository of my work for the course "Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making: Computational and Neural Mechanisms" of a research master's program in Cognitive Neuroscience at Leiden University.

This project investigates how exam stress affects perceptual decision-making using the random dot motion task. Behavioral and computational analyses (via the Drift Diffusion Model) were conducted to compare performance under stress and no-stress conditions. The data used in the assignment is not real.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `DDM_Example.R` – Demonstrates fitting the DDM to sample data.
- `Fit_analysis.R` – Main script for model fitting and extracting parameters.
- `Frequency_Plot.R` – Generates histogram visualizations of reaction times.
- `helper_functions.R` – Contains utility functions used across scripts.
- `README.md` – This file.
